# discord-webhook-nuker
Deletes any discord webhook you need really fast. I made this rq at 5 AM because I had nothing better to do.

## installation
in your terminal, write "py -m pip install os", "py -m pip install requests", "py -m pip install dhooks", and "py -m pip install time". Then run main.py and you are done :)
